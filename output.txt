area new words
but yeah I'm raikkonen in fiery if this works correctly I can make it such that
with this new code that I wrote with the with the listening device
but the listening device I can make it so that it
listening device I can make it
so that the text from the listening I could develop this and use it so that it speaks for me like I can make a sentence that's like how I speak I just wonder how the sound what's your and then I could take this file put it into this and then I'll make us a paragraph of how I speak
will be somewhat coherent I can make it like sound more cookie or enforce is not coherent but it's more and then they'll become like less that's cool no I just want to show you this guy I saw some in the Seine some insane video we can I can stream and share it to you I've got to change Windows
I says and based off of that it will return certain values
bond for him
yeah literally like listen to Listen to It's so weird
hold on let me get here
yeah he made an old guy like it's his voice so he has recordings of his voice
the Indian guy said yes how can I help you and then he responded with he said I accidentally broke my laptop yeah yeah so it's trying to match it together so do you see do you see on the right side of his confidence so it's 80% confident that he said yes how may I help you and yes how am I may I help you is like a chunk that's what's happening if you're under a certain value whatever it won't work or will work and then if it's like really weird he'll be like oh if he has no idea how to respond he'll say oh what did you say and then go get a better response and so this is used as a module called like with a I automatically do some of the stuff for me so he wrote some code here that does this stuff so I was thinking this was the start of it I wanted to listen I wanted to get it started by listening so that it it listens to you guys in a warzone this is here comes to only your comes not my account
oh well why keep it running
is pretty cool
Omar can you still hear me okay
Walmart you tell me if can you just keep speaking say random stuff can you hear me can you hear me okay let me just something up that makes sense yeah you're fine you're fine oh maybe one of the problems is the microphone is Waverly
testing 123, you can still hear me right okay
23k are you playing plunder of the other one like as many as possible until I realized his own isn't looking so pretty journalist
would you say homeless who cut his chin by Omer let's play in 10 minutes yeah yeah cuz I wanted to come tomorrow can't do that I mean I'm not supposed to but I'm going to see what it is my dream share will first then stream share yeah yeah
you've I3 uavs and poppet you have to do it right away 3 and right away
vitamin E yeah just pop 3 top three of them to pop one yesr pop your first one pick it up puppet pick it up pop it so here's the problem within a 200-mile radius it doesn't tell you if there's people unless only hold on hold on let me think of what you're going to do what you need to do here can you show me a map one more time okay
do you have a piece of a selfish of you have 1 gas mask gas mask Precision no no no by to uavs you spend all your money on the movies now how much do you have left by one more you baby do you still have the advanced or no I do these three again pop 03
in your sniper I'll probably go to zonefirst yeah just trying to get the zone now you need a vehicle though while you're running if you press one it should auto run for you
oh you're that shield shield shield shield while running just as fast
run run run zig zags you need to run not like Brian Jesse run just as fast as you are sprinting in fact faster to keep running keep running the best thing is when you're running straight to slide
just keep running and not going to be able to Adam do you want to do slide cancels going straight and John slides and jump slides and drums shieldon he's whatever you can to get cover so just alternate between slides and jumps yeah there you go
alright okay I probably see ya imma go to Zumba try and find somewhere that has unlimited cuz you need shield now that you spent 27 to know tell her I don't know the video for say oh Mikey got to get out of here you are going to die
you need to get to a gaseous or just go straight go to the go right go right go inside that pincer go in the pincer yeah yeah in the store loot up here don't leave until you have to reserve Shields
it's picking it up it says you need to go to the T to a gaseous or go straight right go right go right go inside that penser go inside you need to have it that's probably why you're getting killed doing a Recon right in front of me so be careful pick that up the trophy always have something in your thing like always pick it up you know don't have your sniper out at this range he doesn't miss
no really why we should RP
OUC Museum yeah you might be able to beam him if he's up top you can be a man from here chop up this guy he's down he's going to self res if you can cook that grenade beautiful stun him if you can hear that okay if you can if you hit this done then you're golden
yep feel so fun watching you is that that's a really good secondary close-range really good pretty good actually it's the way that you or the zone as you got to run straight no no you don't need anymore I've got to be careful or you just looked at it on the Satchel left or right forward to the left a little bit more left there's also way up to your right yeah this way up there yet over this ledge you can get up there and then here you don't have your good now now there's one more zip wire
cuz you got to be really careful like the same way you died remember or saw you the same way he get back inside if he has a DMR get back inside the room if you really want over if you can kobiet you can throw a load out right at the door entrance I'll get you stuck stuck like there's no way you miss autosprint or do you do shift Sprint when I get stoned I put my controller down
hello oh I Do by myself
yeah the only this gun has no recoil once you get used to it I use my hack
you're not supposed to hit people from like this kind of range I think also you should spam it and pull your thing down
listening listening listening listening if you want to ask me or it's a top Runner imma look for a money bag and go push him
boost by gear
well testing 123 he almost hitting the Train on Myra kill all these guys okay maybe you shouldn't Miss
thanks a lot for one thing but the way that this game works is a bit different you need to do you get a lot more money you have like 50 k on your body to stop spawning
if you want to go I think the game is over but
now you can't get that
you shouldn't but you didn't kill him or Zone Discord I'm just using I'm just saying words on my my speech recognizer to test something out I was just on stackoverflow and I found out that python is blah blah blah
changing at changing in
testing one two three testing one two three homers looking at Mara Mara is an operator ugly operator Homer look at the Chiraq Muslim he's a milsim
I said no it's a medley so I combined it a bunch of the John Wiki songs and he just threw me into it
this is a new test on my sliding down the damn incaseyoudidntknow mer if you're flying down that damn in a real game used I kind of annoying yeah yeah
the dam and it didn't let me jump off and I don't like that
some of the helicopter
yeah yeah you are yeah you just go back to that place for OU playing solos
are you going to Splatter then you could flatter them
finishing off with other gun finish them off with the shot
I think the left cushion Omer make sure to spam your shots for cardless don't don't you see that's how I shoot it with the shot
downtown on the top or whatever you want to do good knock 15 get rekt go take that money out shoot it with the shot
Spotify
yeah yeah just do I mean in this range now but so he's probably on the other side right through your stun Grenade on the than the whole
Sundowner
you should Crouch could grab that stuff if you put it on hold after next 209 same over
at least I never getting your money oh wow you are marked as a top earner you should Crouch you should grab that stuff if you put it on hold after next 209 same over yudonia land on their find you as make sure you aim down sights when you're shooting at him you see why this gun so good I love it nice nice oh eight hundred eight hundred to you kill em with the DMR
I like your thoughts I like how you think y'all should I just 16,000 what was the highest since you've ever played on DPI on 16000 right now
